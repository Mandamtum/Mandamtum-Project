# Mandamtum-Project - 17/11/18 - VoiceRecognitionTst2
An assistant for windows, and many more OS's to come. Mandamtum is now meant to be an assistant for windows, by responding to certain 
commands, and currently, we have the commands, Mic is required:
* Hello
* Stop
* How are you doing?
* What are you?
* Tell me a joke
* What time is it?
* What is it today?
* Open Google
* Open Youtube
* Open Twitter
* Open Amazon
* Activate (To allow for use, use when...)
* Deactivate (Say to deactivate and stop annoying voice reactions and assumptions.)


# Mandamtum-Project - 20/11/18 - Mandamtum 1.0.0.1
Commands are revised and updated. New ones such as...
* What's the weather? (Sample in Baltimore, Maryland)  - being revamped
* What's the temperature? - being revamped

# Errors -
Errors are being resolved. One problem is it not executing without its design, which does not affect the program's usablility, but a current 
real issue is the repeating "Hi", which you may inform me on how to fix, if you may have experience with .
