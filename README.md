# Mandamtum-Project
An assistant for windows, and many more OS's to come. Mandamtum is now meant to be an assistant for windows, 
by responding to certain commands, and currently, my next goals are to expand response vocabulary to a casual level, 
more widespread actions, make a greater and fresher GUI, and finally, expand out to other OSes, like cars, consoles, etc. 

Currently it can run multiple commands, and currently it is being developed with searching technology. 

Google and Yahoo API's in process of obtaining. 

Copyright and License in process of obtaining. 

I am starting up a twitter and I am going to use for up to date informing.


# Next Goals
' Expand Vocabulary, receiving and response.

' Modify Voice

' Open Source Plans

' GUI Updates
