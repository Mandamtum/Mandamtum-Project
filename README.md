# Mandamtum-Project - 17/11/18 - VoiceRecognitionTst2
Just a little test I'm performing for an upcoming project I'll be doing the future.
* Hello
* Stop
* How are you doing?
* What are you?
* Tell me a joke
* What time is it?
* What is it today?
* Open Google
* Open Youtube
* Open Twitter
* Open Amazon
* Activate (To allow for use, use when...)
* Deactivate (Say to deactivate and stop annoying voice reactions and assumptions.)

# Errors -
Errors are being resolved. One problem is it not executing without its design, which does not affect the program's usablility, but a current 
real issue is the repeating "Hi", which you may inform me on how to fix, if you may have experience with . 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE HOME PAGE OF MANDAMTUM VOICE RECOGNITION, AND OTHER MAJOR FEATURES ARE BEING MOVED, MADE, AND DEVELOPED IN OTHER REPOSITORIES FOR ORGANIZATION.
